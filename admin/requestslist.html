		<h1>Chisel Requests</h1>
		<p><i>Last updated: 13 April 2006</i></p>
		<h2>Requests since 2.1 "HVRC Edition" was released</h2>
		<p>Developers interested in contributing are recommended to choose a topic from the list below before considering items in the archived list. Contact michael.louka@hrp.no before starting though, to make sure that someone is not already working on the request you are interested in!</p>
 
 <pre>
    Req 1: X3D Binary export
    
    Req 2: Add option to show line numbers in edit window
    
    Req 3: Chisel needs exit codes when run from command line (or does it have these already?)
 
    Req 4: Ability to center, scale, transpose coordinates
    
    Req 5: Title bar of Chisel application should change when loading new file
    
    Req 6: Nested Transform collapser
           (for unnamed transforms only)
    
    Req 7: Scene graph overview option
          (show scene graph as a tree to aid navigation in the code)
    
    Req 8: Filename in window title bar should indicate if file is changed but not saved

    Req 9: Elevation grid splitter needs grouping and LODing options

    Req 10: Need easy way to switch between multiple open files and view summary info

    Req 11: Constrained Delaunay triangulator

    Req 12: Restructure to enable &quot;Chisel&quot; to be more easily used as a Java library
            (split into chisel-core &amp; chisel-gui jars and provide a clean public API to chisel-core)
            Can base on the clvorlon &amp; clchisel code.

    Req 13: Remove use of HTML reports for configuration
            (use XML instead and strip out the HTML parsing code)</pre>

		<h2>Archived Requests</h2>
		<p>Requests from before 2006 were registered as bugs, but have now been archived below to make the list of genuine bugs easier to work with. Those with number in square brackets after the bug number have been assigned new request numbers. Those that have not been reasigned have been judged unlikely to be implemented in the foreseeable future. Of course, items that have not been assigned new request numbers can be promoted if there is enough interest in them or if a developer wishes to contribute a solution for one of these to the codebase.</p>
